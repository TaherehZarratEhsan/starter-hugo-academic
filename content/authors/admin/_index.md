I have earned my M.Sc. and B.Sc. degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Guilan, with a primary research focus on computer vision, machine learning, and deep learning. My thesis delved into violence detection in video sequences through the application of image and video processing techniques.

I am enthusiastic about exploring opportunities for research collaboration in these areas. If you are interested, please feel free to contact me at zarrat.ehsan [AT] gmail.com.
