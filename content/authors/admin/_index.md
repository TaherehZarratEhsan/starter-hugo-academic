I received my M.Sc. degree in Electrical engineering from University of Guilan. The main focus of my research has been computer vision and deep learning. Currently, I am an independent researcher, working on deep neural network architectures and medical image analysis. 

I am open to research collaboration in the relevant areas if you are interested, feel free to contact me: zarrat.ehsan [AT] gmail.com

I am looking for a Ph.D. position.
