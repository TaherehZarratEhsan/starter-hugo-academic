Throughout my research endeavors, I have cultivated a robust foundation in computer vision, machine learning, and deep learning. The culmination of my research efforts is reflected in eight papers, with five of them expounded upon in this essay.  In the first paper, a handcrafted feature based on human trajectory is proposed to differentiate between normal and violence actions. The feature was trained with SVM for classification. In the second project, I trained a deep CNN for violence recognition. Deep networks needs a large dataset to automatically identify patterns and extract features from complex data. Given the constraints of a limited annotated dataset, the works in this domain often struggle with generalizability to Out-of-Distribution data.  Recognizing this challenge, my focus shifted towards enhancing generalizability. I proposed several techniques, including representation learning using Autoencoders (AE) and generative modeling through Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). To the best of my knowledge, the investigation into increasing generalization in violence recognition had not been previously undertaken. My innovative approaches were groundbreaking in this regard. In comparison to prevailing state-of-the-art methodologies, my contributions yielded substantial results, showcasing a remarkable 40% improvement in generalization accuracy across new real-world environments. This achievement underscores the efficacy of my novel approaches in not only advancing the field but also addressing the critical issue of generalizability in violence recognition.
