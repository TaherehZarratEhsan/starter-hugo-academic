Throughout my research endeavors, I have cultivated a robust foundation in computer vision, machine learning, and deep learning. my research on violence detection is reflected in 7 papers, so far. First, I started my work by designing handcrafted features based on motion patterns to discriminate between violence and normal action. Continuing my work, I started to work on deep learning techniques such as CNN. Deep networks need a large dataset to automatically identify patterns and extract features from complex data. Given the constraints of a limited annotated dataset, the works in this domain often struggle with generalizability to Out-of-Distribution data. Recognizing this challenge, my focus shifted towards enhancing generalizability. I proposed several techniques, including representation learning using Autoencoders (AE) and generative modeling through Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). To the best of my knowledge, the investigation into increasing generalization in violence recognition had not been previously undertaken. In comparison to state-of-the-art methodologies, my contributions yielded substantial results, showcasing a remarkable 40% improvement in generalization accuracy across new real-world environments.
